Hello, nice to meet you!

I’m a Systems Analyst with around 3 years of experience in RPA solutions. I play a key role in building automations using Automation Anywhere and PL/SQL. I design solutions for different business areas, helping clients identify processes suitable for automation. In addition, I implement the technical solutions and provide ongoing support for existing automations.

I also work on creating queries for API development, enabling smoother integrations between systems. Currently, I’m studying Python and JavaScript to further support and enhance my implementations. 

Outside of work, you’ll probably find me playing online games, listening to way too much music, drawing, exploring new places, or recharging my energy in nature 😎
